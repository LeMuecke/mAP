Getting Started
===============

Hello there! In this page, you will learn how to get started with this repo.
By the end of this section, you will be able to get the code running and start evaluating your own object detector!

Set-up
------

First we need to set-up (1.) `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_, (2.) `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_, and (3.) the following python packages: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `lxml`, `sphinx`, `matplotlib`, and `tqdm`.


If you already have Python and pip installed you can skip to step (3.).

Step-by-step:
  1. Firstly, you need to `install Python <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_.
  2. Secondly, you need to `install pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.
  3. Lastly, install the required python libraries using the following command:

     `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Running the code
----------------

First, clone this repository to your computer:

    `git clone https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP`

Then, you need to set-up the input files. I made this code as flexible as possible for you, so, for running the code it really depends on the object detector that you are using. Please select one of the following options:

.. raw:: html
   :file: running_the_code.html
